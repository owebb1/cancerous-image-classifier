## Meetings


### Notes 3/3 Meeting 
- Lets uses both parallelize from python and terrels CNN output as our next steps


##### Linear SVM:
- This is taking forever, might just have to leave for days
- Look into how we might create this on its own computer

##### Parallel SVM:
- This should be easy in python. We should just spread it around the cores on the CS computers to allow it to just hang out.

##### CNN:
- Should be super fast because already trained, should just use saved output
- Hopefully won't have to retrain

##### Action Items:
- Try to get my own CS computer from the CS Department
  - This would be talking to Jeff Knerr
- Reach out to T for code 
- Think about how to actually run this thing


### Notes 2/* Meetings
- histogram of the features
- histogram of the positive and negative
- PCA could reduce -- doubtful though because of the way it is set up
- luminance and chromanance
- 8-bit pixel depth vs np.float
- feature extraction 
  - convolutional neural network @terell dale
